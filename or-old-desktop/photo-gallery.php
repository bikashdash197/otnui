						<p>It is this time of the year when unmarried girls don new clothes, makeup, mehendi and take to swings while merrymaking with friends. Raja Parba is a three-day festival to celebrate womanhood. Raja is a mass festival but due to the ongoing second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, people in the State this year have preferred to celebrate at their homes with their dear and near ones. Let's take a tour across Odisha to find out how people are celebrating the festival while keeping with the pandemic protocol.</p><a href="https://odishatv.in/photo-gallery/festivals-events/in-pics-colours-of-raja-in-the-shadow-of-pandemic-49446" class="search-result-news-type"><i class="far fa-images"></i></a></div>

						<p>Once the tourism sector in Odisha revives after the Covid pandemic, a visual treat would greet the tourists when they step into Raghurajpur, the heritage village of Puri. Amidst a raging pandemic that has drawn curtains on the livelihood of the artists, Odisha Lalit Kala Akademi in collaboration with the state culture department came up with an innovative idea and organised a traditional Mural camp (pattachitra) at Raghurajpur from June 9 to 13, 2021. Families of as many as 150 artisans participated in this camp by painting the walls and the front portion of their own houses. The Akademi will provide Rs 10,000 remuneration to each family while five best works would receive awards, informed Akademi president and acclaimed sand artist Sudarsan Pattnaik.</p><a href="https://odishatv.in/photo-gallery/festivals-events/welcome-to-raghurajpur-murals-in-puri-s-heritage-village-a-visual-treat-for-all-49378" class="search-result-news-type"><i class="far fa-images"></i></a></div>

						<p>A very severe cyclonic storm Yaas pounded the coastal districts in north Odisha when it hit the coast around 9 AM on Wednesday. Several low lying areas were inundated and trees uprooted amid the storm surge. Apprehensive of an extensive damage, the Odisha government had evacuated over six lakh people from low-lying and vulnerable areas of north coastal and adjoining districts, which has reportedly ensured zero casualty in the calamity. After the landfall process was complete, immediate road clearance was done by NDRF, ODRAF and police personnel for restoration of normalcy. Here are some pictures of the devastation and the post cyclone restoration works carried out in all the affected areas.</p><a href="https://odishatv.in/photo-gallery/weather/cyclone-yaas-in-odisha-the-devastation-immediate-restoration-47384" class="search-result-news-type"><i class="far fa-images"></i></a></div>
